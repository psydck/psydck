- 👋 Hi, I’m Sizwe I. Mkhonza
- 👀 I’m interested in ... computer system's engineering
  
- ⚡ The Evolution of My Coding Journey:
My coding adventure began with `C#`, where I crafted console apps and later transitioned to graphical user interface (GUI) applications using `Windows Forms`.
As I gained confidence, I ventured into the world of web development with `Microsoft ASP.NET`.

However, I soon felt constrained by being tied to a single language and sought to explore other domains.
My curiosity in mobile app development led me to `Java`, where I discovered `Android` and learned its ins and outs alongside Java programming.
The similarity between Java and `C#` was like finding a long-lost sibling!

My computing background should have started with `Assembly Code`, but instead, I took a Digital Systems Fundamentals course that introduced me to transistors, logic gates, and integrated circuits (IC).
This foundation led me to learn Assembly, which initially seemed daunting due to its procedural nature and lack of object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm.
After overcoming the initial challenges, I successfully applied my knowledge and even developed an application using Assembly.
As I continued developing mobile apps, I encountered issues with inherent bugs that caused unexpected crashes. 
To overcome these obstacles, I delved into debugging strategies like `unit testing` and `test automation` to ensure my code was robust and reliable.

Here are some of my projects:
- [TillPoint](https://github.com/wastedMynd/Tillr2) : Mobile application that allows users to manage point of sale transactions;
  it's intended to be quick and easy to use; this is achieved by incorporating Android's intuitive Material Design GUI Components.
